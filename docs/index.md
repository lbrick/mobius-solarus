We’ll play on the Möbius solarus – a Möbius strip 100km wide and 1 million km long,  encircling  a sun. One rotation takes a human lifetime, creating an eternal migration as communities follow the sunlight. Magic flows from solar exposure, making the light/dark divide not just environmental but mystical. Those who dwell in darkness must find other ways to survive.
