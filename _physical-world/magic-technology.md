## Sunlight and Magic:

- **Solaris Magic**:
  During the sunlit era, magic is abundant and accessible. Spells are infused with solar power, creating grand magical achievements such as enchanted cities, flying ships, and power-infused artifacts. Solaris mages wield power directly tied to solar exposure, gaining stronger abilities during the day and crafting spells that capture and extend solar energy.

- **Eclipse Sorcery**:
  Those who dwell in shadow develop specialized magics, relying on darkness and subtle energies. Some learn to manipulate bioluminescent flora, summon shadowy entities, or cast necromantic spells that draw power from within. Over time, a network of dark-adept sorcerers may emerge, rivaling the strength of solaris magic in their own eerie, tenebrous way.

- **Forbidden Solar-Shadow Fusions**:
  Some mages, curious and ambitious, delve into combining solaris and shadow powers, creating hybrid magics that are potent yet unpredictable. These techniques are controversial and even feared, viewed as unnatural by both solar and shadow-aligned practitioners.
