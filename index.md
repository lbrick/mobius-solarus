We’ll play on the Möbius solarus – a Möbius strip 100km wide and 1 million km long,  encircling  a sun. One rotation takes a human lifetime, creating an eternal migration as communities follow the sunlight. Magic flows from solar exposure, making the light/dark divide not just environmental but mystical. Those who dwell in darkness must find other ways to survive.

## Session Zero Agenda:

- [Physical World](physical-world/physical-world.md)
    - Climate & survival challenges
    - Natural resources
    - Geography (landmarks, obstacles)
    - Day/twilight/night zones – how sharp are these boundaries?
    - Magic & Technology
    - How does solar magic manifest?
    - Can sunlight/magic be stored?
    - What technologies help people survive/navigate?
    - Dark side alternatives to magic?

- [Society & Culture](society-culture/society-culture.md)
    - How do communities handle migration?
    - Major cultural groups to start with?
    - Relations between light/dark dwellers
    - Basic political structures
- Player Character Context
    - Where are they in the migration cycle?
    - Their role in society?
    - Group’s relationship to the eternal movement?
    - Starting resources/knowledge
- Immediate Situation
    - Current threats/conflicts
    - Local power groups
    - Pressing problems to solve
    - Available opportunities
        - Strip World Scale AnalysisGiven dimensions:
            - Strip width: 5 km
            - Strip length: 1 million km
            - Strip forms a Möbius loop around the sun
            - Must rotate once per human lifetime (~75 years)For comparison:
            - Earth’s sun radius: ~696,340 km
            - Mercury’s orbital radius: ~57.9 million kmSuggested configuration:
            - Sun radius: ~50,000 km (about 1/14th of our Sun)
            - Small enough to allow reasonable orbit
            - Large enough to be imposing2. Strip orbital radius: ~159,000 km
            - Strip length of 1 million km = circumference
            - This gives radius of roughly 159,000 km
            - Places strip well outside sun’s surface
            - Allows for “barrier zone” of ~100,000 km3. Barrier zone:
            - Visible energy field/ancient forcefield
            - Extends 100,000 km from sun’s surface
            - Completely blocks heat/radiation
            - Only allows beneficial light/magical energy throughThis configuration would:
            - Keep the sun imposingly large in the “sky”
            - Make the strip’s curve gentle enough to appear nearly flat locally
            - Allow for plausible “ancient technology” protection
            - Maintain mystery about the sun’s true nature
