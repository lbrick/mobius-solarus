The Möbius strip completes one full rotation every few hundred years, creating a world where communities can remain in sunlight for long stretches, yet they must eventually face the approach of darkness if they choose not to migrate. Magic flows from solar exposure, making the light/dark divide not just environmental but mystical. Those who dwell in darkness must find other ways to survive.

## Session Zero Agenda:

- Physical World
    - Climate & survival challenges
    - Natural resources
    - Geography (landmarks, obstacles)
    - Day/twilight/night zones – how sharp are these boundaries?
    - Magic & Technology
    - How does solar magic manifest?
    - Can sunlight/magic be stored?
    - What technologies help people survive/navigate?
    - Dark side alternatives to magic?

- Society & Culture
    - How do communities handle migration?
    - Major cultural groups to start with?
    - Relations between light/dark dwellers
    - Basic political structures
- Player Character Context
    - Where are they in the migration cycle?
    - Their role in society?
    - Group’s relationship to the eternal movement?
    - Starting resources/knowledge
- Immediate Situation
    - Current threats/conflicts
    - Local power groups
    - Pressing problems to solve
    - Available opportunities
        - Strip World Scale AnalysisGiven dimensions:
            - Strip width: 5 km
            - Strip length: 1 million km
            - Strip forms a Möbius loop around the sun
            - Must rotate once per human lifetime (~75 years)For comparison:
            - Earth’s sun radius: ~696,340 km
            - Mercury’s orbital radius: ~57.9 million kmSuggested configuration:
            - Sun radius: ~50,000 km (about 1/14th of our Sun)
            - Small enough to allow reasonable orbit
            - Large enough to be imposing2. Strip orbital radius: ~159,000 km
            - Strip length of 1 million km = circumference
            - This gives radius of roughly 159,000 km
            - Places strip well outside sun’s surface
            - Allows for “barrier zone” of ~100,000 km3. Barrier zone:
            - Visible energy field/ancient forcefield
            - Extends 100,000 km from sun’s surface
            - Completely blocks heat/radiation
            - Only allows beneficial light/magical energy throughThis configuration would:
            - Keep the sun imposingly large in the “sky”
            - Make the strip’s curve gentle enough to appear nearly flat locally
            - Allow for plausible “ancient technology” protection
            - Maintain mystery about the sun’s true nature
